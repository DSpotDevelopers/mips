## Specification

### Motivation

Recent events (see RWF-001 facilitator and MKR-001 offboardings below) have shown the process for involuntarily offboarding facilitators and core units could be improved. These changes are an attempt to make the process more transparent, orderly, and conducive to substantive discussion surrounding an offboarding proposal prior to a vote.

#### Specific Goals

* Clarify that a Core Unit can be offboarded in the same governance cycle as removing its budget and facilitator(s).
* Establish a standard for proposers to include detailed reasoning.
* Add an explicit Facilitator succession plan so that election by active Facilitators becomes a fall-back process.

### Amended MIPs and Components

* MIP39c2: Adding/Modifying Core Units
* MIP39c3: Removing Core Units
* MIP40c3: Adding/Modifying Core Unit Budget Process
* MIP41c5: Facilitator Offboarding
