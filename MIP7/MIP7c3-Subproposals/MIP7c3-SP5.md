### Domain Team Introduction

The Risk Domain team has been working for the betterment of the Maker Protocol, starting with Single-Collateral Dai and continuing to this day with Multi-Collateral Dai.

- Maximize Protocol self-sustainability and robustness
- Scale Real World Assets:
  - Define a model to assess/monitor RWA risks
