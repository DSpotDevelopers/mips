### Payment Implementation

The MKR payment implementation will have two elements and include a phased MKR distribution comparable to the [DUX MKR Flow](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp27-development-ux-core-unit-mkr-budget-dux-001/9777). The first is a Deco Reserves multisig and a the second is a Deco Operational wallet. The Auditor Wallet will receive each MKR disbursement Six (6) months prior to the vest date. Three (3) months prior to vest the MKR will be distributed from the Auditor Wallet to the Deco Operational wallet requiring a 2 of 3 quorum for release to vesting. Upon vest, the Deco operational wallet will release the vested MKR.

This payment implementation makes no assumptions regarding the origin of the MKR. It may be moved from the protocolâ€™s treasury, newly minted, or obtained from another source.

The MKR that is held by the Deco Auditor Wallet and the Deco Operational Wallet will not be used for voting, signaling, or any other type of governance participation. It will remain in the wallets untouched until it moves to the next step in the process.

The Deco team may consider alternative payment flows compliant with [DssVest](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip-54-dssvest/8025) if the standardized flow is compatible with the vesting schedule and that the risk is deemed acceptable by the team.
