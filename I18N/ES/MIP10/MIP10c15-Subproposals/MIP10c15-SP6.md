### Light Feeds
**Reputation**
- Does the organization have a strong reputation in the crypto community?

MyCrypto, is recognize as one of the pioneers of the Ethereum ecosystem, dating back to its MyEtherWallet origins. Many crypto-natives can trace their crypto origin story back to generating their first Ethereum wallet through MyCrypto. MyCrypto was one of the first to recognize the dire state of UX and lack of education in the Ethereum ecosystem and adopted a design philosophy centered around these cornerstones. This has rightfully earned them a strong trusted reputation.

- What contributions has this organization made to the crypto ecosystem?

MyCrypto provides a client-side, open-source interface to the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to access and manage their ETH & ERC20 tokens, and interact with smart contracts directly, among many other things. MyCrypto also provides infrastructure with an Ethereum node, alongside
Infura and Etherscan.

- Would including the organization as a Light Feed instill a sense of trust in the Oracles?

MyCrypto is a long-standing and trusted member of the Ethereum community whose inclusion as a Light Feed would be valuable addition to the circle of trust backing MakerDAOs Oracles.

- Are there any public accusations of misconduct? How severe and numerous are they? Have they been confirmed?

The Oracle Team makes no deliberation on whether any inappropriate activity occurred. In the pursuit of full transparency, the fork from MyEtherWallet is something Maker Governors may want to consider.

Here are the two published first-hand accounts from [Taylor (MyCrypto)](https://medium.com/mycrypto/mycrypto-launch-6a066bf41093) and [Kosala (MEW)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7wgnds/official_myetherwallet_statement/).

It's important to acknowledge the team behind MyEtherWallet team transitioned to MyCrypto in the aftermath of the dissolution of MyEtherWallet LLC.

**Verification** 

- Were sufficient public-facing resources provided or found that confirm the information in the application?
The Oracle Team was able to identify the existence of the Delaware C Corp MyCrypto through the [Delaware Division of Corporations Register](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/ecorp/entitysearch/NameSearch.aspx) with file number 6673533 and registered on 12/6/2017. There is a minor discrepancy here as the applicant claimed to be incorporated in 2018

- Was the applicant honest with respect to:
	- the investors
        The Oracle Team was able to confirm the investors from both the source provided by the applicant as well as external sources including [Polychain](https://jobs.polychain.capital/companies), [ShapeShift](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/mycrypto-series-a--d1c7877a#section-investors), [BoostVC](https://www.boost.vc/portfolio), [Ausum Ventures](https://www.ausum.vc/portfolio), [Albert Ni](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/albert-ni#section-overview), [Mick Hagen](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/mick-hagen#section-overview), [Chance Du](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/chance-du#section-overview), and [Lily Liu](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/lily-liu-0251#section-personal-investments)
	- how much funding was raised
	- the number of employees
	- the location of incorporation & domicile

- Given the applicant's major investors, is there a risk adding this Light Feed would give a single investor too much influence over the Oracle protocol?
The Oracle Team does not see any conflict of interest arising from amount of influence any single investor may have.

- Given the incorporation and domicile location of the organization, is there a risk adding this Light Feed would give a single jurisdiction too much influence over the Oracle protocol?
The Oracle Team does not see any issue with regards to jurisdictional influence accrual that adding MyCrypto would pertain.

**Identity**
- Did the Oracle Team get in contact with the organization to confirm their application?
Yes the Oracle Team talked directly to Taylor Monahan the Founder and CEO of MyCrypto.

### Cost-Benefit
- Given the ratio of Dark Feeds : Light Feeds, does the Maker Protocol benefit from adding another Dark/Light Feed at this time?
The Oracle Team believes that an additional Light Feed from an esteemed company like MyCrypto is appropriate given the current number of Dark Feeds relative to Light Feeds.

- Given the extra cost of appointing a new Feed, does the benefit of the marginal security / marginal trust in the protocol exceed the cost?
As the Maker Protocol is scaling in size both in terms of deposits as well as outstanding Dai supply, it requires a greater and greater security threshold. Adding a new Light Feed at this point time seems prudent.

### Oracle Team Recommendation
Given the stellar reputation MyCrypto has built up not just as an infrastructure provider, but as a core member of the Ethereum community and industry-leader in the education and UX domains the Oracle Team highly recommends the Maker Governance community consider appointing MyCrypto as a Light Feed for the Maker Oracles.
