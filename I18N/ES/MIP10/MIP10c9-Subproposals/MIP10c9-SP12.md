## Sentence Summary
MIP10c9-SP12 whitelists B.Protocol contract for ETH/USD Oracle Access.

## Disclaimer

MIP10 is meant to handle all of the Oracle related actions. Unfortunately MIP10 has inconsistencies and doesnâ€™t conform to the monthly governance cadence that the Maker Improvement Proposal framework is built around. This has generated a backlog of Oracle proposals. While MIP10 is refactored to conform to the regular MIP process, Oracle proposals such as this one will utilize the more liberal weekly governance cycle. While strictly speaking this makes them not subproposals, they are included in the subproposal archive as a point of provenance to serve as a paper trail.

## Specification

### Introduction

[B.Protocol](https://medium.com/b-protocol/b-protocol-b6dd4e3bf9c0) makes lending platforms more stable by incentivizing liquidity providers (keepers) to commit on liquidation of under collateralized loans and shift the miners extracted profits back to the users of the platform. 
We integrated B.Protocol with MakerDAO, letting the users interact with the lending platform they are used to, via a dedicated smart contract interface. B.Protocol liquidators get a priority in the liquidation process which helps them manage risk in a more predictable manner. In return, Liquidators share their proceeds with B.Protocol users, making it a win-win situation for all parties involved:
 
* MakerDAO as a platform get [additional players](https://medium.com/b-protocol/the-genesis-backstop-b-protocol-brings-new-players-to-defi-liquidations-74619b11486e) to participate in the liquidation process.
* Users get extra value (share the liquidation proceeds) with no extra risk.
Liquidators get better predictions and hence can better manage their risk.


B.Protocol is using the oracle to determine the amount of collateral to confiscated in return to the DAI debt.
